              Text
          </h2>
          <p>
            The text can be any type
            of different text
            elements, such as
            <code>&#60;p&#62;</code>,
            <code>&#60;h3&#62;</code>,
            <code>&#60;h6&#62;</code>
            and so on. The text is 
            white (hex color code:
            #FAFAFA) and has a <code>
            font-family</code> value
            of "Roboto Slab". The font 
            is fetched from Google
            Fonts.
          </p>
          <p class='strong'>
            Be careful not to write
            too much text on one slide
            since the overflowed text
            cannot be read!!

            <li>An unordered list is not the only type of list available... there is also an ordered list!</li>

              <li class='strong'>Bolded ordered list item</li>

            Icons
          </h2>
          <p>
            An icon can be used to explain, more visually, a slide's content.
            This project utilizes the Material Icons provided by Google
            Fonts. If you are interested in using this custom HTML element,
            then it is advised that you only use an icon at the beginning
            of a slide. All the previous slides are a good example of that.

            Not Supported
          </h2>
          <p>
            As amazing as this project is, it does not support all types of
            content. Reason being that the developer of this custom HTML
            element is simply just too lazy to do anything about it.
            Here is a list of all the HTML elements that do not have a
            solid support:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Images</li>
            <li>Audio</li>
            <li>Maps</li>
            <li>SVG's</li>

          <p>
            This project really has no meaning whatsoever other
            than to present what the developer is capable of
            doing with the current web technologies available.
            I hope this has been a pleasent testing for you,
            as odd as it may seem there has been a lot of work
            and care put into this. Anyways, check out the portfolio!
