        is an Android game where you move a sphere around by tilting your
        device. Your task is to find out the layout of a maze you are stuck in
        but once you figure out the whole maze, you finish the level. Be
        careful, though. There's not a lot of space on each plane and if you fall
        down, you have to start the level again from the beginning. Also, watch
        out for traps.
