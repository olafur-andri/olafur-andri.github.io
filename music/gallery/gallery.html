        This page is an overview of some of the music I've made throughout the

      <p id="license_text">
        The music that you can find here is entirely free for any use, but I
        would very much like it if I was credited in whatever work you're using
        it in. Providing a link to this website or anything along those lines
        would be greatly appreciated.
