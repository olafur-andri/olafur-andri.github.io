- [ ] It would be very nice to be able to have a setting where the user can change their preferred color scheme (light / dark / automatic)
	- [ ] For this, I'll need to re-think the `<header />` a bit (make it more like Monkeytype instead of what I have now)
	- [ ] The theme button should update the website's theme if the user chooses a theme that is different from the current one
	- [ ] The theme button should highlight (somehow) the option that corresponds to the active theme
	- [ ] The theme button should save the user's preferred theme in `localStorage`

- [ ] Routing
	- [ ] On '/' it should show me the front page
	- [ ] On '/raddle' it should show the front page of my custom Raddle system. It has a small explanation of what the system is and links to Raddles that I have made myself.
		- [ ] It should link to the original Raddle website and state that as the inspiration for this whole project
	- [ ] On '/raddle/{data}' it should show me the custom Raddle that is encoded in the *data* field
		- [ ] It'd also be nice to be able to link to the original Raddle page from this page as well.
	- [ ] On '/raddle/maker' it should show the page that users can use to create their own Raddles

- [ ] Gotta make sure that users don't lose their progress when they refresh the page
	- [ ] While playing a premade Raddle game
	- [ ] While playing a custom Raddle game
	- [ ] While making a Raddle game

- [ ] Once you've published the updated version of your webpage to GitHub Pages, try to refresh your Raddle game (ideally when your URL is `olafur-andri.github.io/something/`). Does it break anything?

- [ ] Make sure that the Christmas Carol game is also available in this new website
- [ ] Do we really need to link to Google Fonts?
- [ ] Make sure that the link to your Raddle system is on your front page
