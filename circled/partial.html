      <p>CIRCLED is an Android game that seeks to bring new life to Snake, a game made popular by Nokia phones shortly before the year 2000. You play as a Circle, or a series of Circles, that move across the level to eat Cookies. With every devoured Cookie, a new Circle is created and appended to the series of Circles. You may not hit the edges of the screen or yourself since that will start the game over.</p>

      <p>The game also provides some extended functionalities. Such as a local and global leaderboard and themes. Each different theme changes the way the game looks and therefore, how it feels. The leaderboards give you a chance to compete with yourself and others throughout the world to reach the highest attainable score.</p>
